__Features__

__Advantages__

This bot can be used for educational purposes as it provides a introduction to Javascript -> Node.js -> Discord.js and allows the user to:
1. Create commands and edit them.
2. Edit functions of the bot to create the personal server experience
2. Edit the bot GitHub repository within the Discord enviroment.

#### *For the begineer...*

__What is a Disocrd bot?__

First, what is Discord? Direct from Nelly, Chief Robot Hamster. Eater of cheeses. Maker of boops, is her [Parents Guild to Discord](https://blog.discordapp.com/parents-guide-to-discord-c77d91793e9c), which gives the best overview to people of all ages what Discord really is. 

"Discord is a free voice, video and text chat app for teens and adults ages 13 and up. It was created to bring people together through a love of gaming. Teens can access Discord via their PC, browser, or mobile phone. Once there, they can join a chat theyâ€™ve been invited to or they can create private servers and invite their friends to play and discuss games by voice, text or video. They can also message each other individually or in group chats with up to ten other friends."

Discord basically is a chat/voice/video service that connects people around the world with their service. 
A bot (short for robot), is an automated user that interacts with real users in a positive manner (bots can even interact with bots!) on Discord. To interact with a bot, you can add a bot of your choice (there are many out there such as this one!) to your server (a chat with many sub-chats (channels) and voice channels where you can talk) and it will interact with the users in that server. 
1. Some examples of interactions:
A user types in a *command* into a channel and a bot responds by...

* Replying a message to the user in the chat
* Adding a function to the bot (a timer, new command, etc.)
* The bot searching Google
* The bot joining a voice channel and playing a song
* And the list goes on and on and on...

(A *Command* usually consist of a prefix followed by a keyword. For example with GC System, "GC!" (the prefix) and then a keyword of your choice that determines the type of interaction "info", or "GC!info" will result in bot replying with information about the bot)

As you can see, the versatility of a Discord bot is amazing and the posibilities are endless. Disocrd being only 2 years old, has over 45 million users and is now a major competitor of Skype and TeamSpeak. 
Now imagine if all those user's servers had bots... We want Game Corner System to reach all of them.
